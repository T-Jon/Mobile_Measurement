# Mobile Measurement SQL Queries
### Repository of working Query Library while working with MMP.

This repository houses commonly used SQL queries used during my tenure working with a MMP.
These are a conglomeration queries that originated from various places and through various connections. 
These queries may be in their original state or heavily modified (Frankin-queried) to suit the needs of client request or personal use-cases.
This library serves as a foundation upon which various use-cases may be derived.
